Our team created a robust and fault-tolerant synthetic data pipeline to sequentially generate images according to each class label. This was done in order to generate images in parallel across multiple machines without losing progress if one failed. Roughly 4,400 images were generated with stable diffusion over the span of a few days. PyTorch was used to train convolutional neural networks that performed with an accuracy of 90% on testing and validation sets they had never seen real data for. This could also be used to enhance existing datasets, where a model could be pre-trained on synthetic data to learn important features and later fine-tuned on real data.",

The robot itself is a turtlebot 3 burger running ROS, mapping it's immediate surroundings using a LIDAR sensor. It would report readings back to a host computer over ROS topics, which would estimate the position of the robot to the maze walls using a Kalman filter according to the internal wheel odometry and external wall positions. OpenCV was used to compute unexplored frontiers to investigate. An A* algorithm with a heuristic was used to determine the best frontier and how to navigate to it, and a cubic spline was provided for the turtlebot to follow. When the turtlebot detected it had been disturbed, it used Monte Carlo localization to find where it was in the maze, and return to the starting position.",

The demo entailed detecting objects of interest, determining their position in the workspace, and controlling the robotic arm to sort them into their respective bins. Both the controls for the OpenManipulator-X arm and vision processing pipeline were built using MATLAB. The arm consisted of four servos that could control position and velocity. The dimensions of the arm linkages and position of the servos could be used to derive the position of the arm in space with forward kinematics. Once the position of an object of interest was identified, inverse kinematics was to determine the configuration of the arm to manipulate the target. In order to reach the target, we calculated the Jacobian of the end effector, which could be used to translate between the robot joint space and the working space. Using cubic trajectory interpolation and the Jacobian, the robot can generate a smooth control signal to manipulate the target objects.",

        "goal": "Create a competitive robot for the 2022 First Robotics Competetion by implementing and automating robotic subsystems.",
        "description": "Jazzy Judi was the robot built by my high school robotics team for the 2022 FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) game Rapid React. My duties to the team included distributing work to other programmers, teaching new members, and communicating with other sub-teams what was in progress or needed to be done. I was also the operator during competitions, diagnosing problems and modifying the code on the fly according to the demands of the current match. The technical solutions I implemented for the robot ranged from game piece tracking using OpenCV and GRIP, automation of subsystems to keep the driver focused on the game, and creation of one of the best autonomous routines in the state. </p><p>I implemented three main sections of automation: Driving, game piece manipulation, and climbing. For driving, I used internal odometry and a trajectory tracking algorithms to follow splines supplied to the robot. Additionally, I implemented a vision pipeline with GRIP and OpenCV to track and follow game pieces while ignoring similar objects. Game piece manipulation consisted of coordinating internal subsystems including the intake, indexer, and shooter to make scoring as simple as pressing a button to intake a ball, and another button to score. The first button press would deploy the protected intake from behind the bumper to grab a ball. The ball would move into the indexer, where a color sensor would determine if it was our team's ball, ejecting the ball if it was not our own. The shooter flywheels would then be spun up to the correct speed to score from where we were on the field, and the driver would press the next button to score. Finally, the climbing sequence  was carfully calibrated to move as quickly and safely up the rungs as possible by managaging velocity and external torque on the arms.</p><p>Some background on the competition to help put my contributions into context: the 2022 Rapid React First Robotics Competition consisted of two alliances of three robots from individual teams, each trying to score more points than the other. Points were scored by shooting game pieces, essentially basketball sized tennis balls, into a funnel at the center of the field. The task I am the most proud of is the four ball autonomous routine, where the robot collected and scored four game pieces in the first 15 seconds of the game. This was a huge factor in our success winning the Colorado regional and ranking 7th in our division of the international championship.",
