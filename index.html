                Hi! My name is Diego and I'm a third year at Worcester Polytechnic Institute pursuing a combined Bachelor's/Master's in <b>Computer Science</b> along with a Bachelor's in <b>Robotics Engineering</b>. I specialize in building functional, clean, and modular prototypes on small Agile teams, quickly delivering high quality results. I love to learn and dive head first into complex problems!
            </p>
            <p>
                 I've been programming since high school, where I learned teamwork and software skills through my robotics team as the lead programmer. Since then, I've worked on many personal and team projects. Check them all out through the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> dropdown above!
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time I like to play the guitar, climb, and build computers.

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
                I graduated from Denver East High School in 2022 with a Certificate of Academic Excellence in both math and engineering. I was also very keen on learning computer science but had exhausted all the Computer Science classes offered at my high school by my second year, so I took concurrent enrollment classes in computer science at the University of Colorado (both the Denver and Boulder campuses).
            </p>
            <p>
                I now attend <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/about">Worcester Polytechnic Institute</a> for it's project-based curriculum and strong multi-disciplinary engineering program, consistently making the Dean's list every semester with a GPA of 3.9. I will be traveling to Spain in Spring of 2025 on a team developing air monitoring sensors around a school in order to help keep students in a healthy learning environment by providing administrators a digital replica of the school and showing the quality of the breathable environment.

            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <p>
                I worked at <a href="https://thedenovo.com/">DeNOVO Solutions</a> for the past two summers as a software engineering intern on two separate projects.
            </p>   
            <p> 
                My first role was helping an <b>agile</b> team of software engineers develop a full-stack Atlassian Jira plugin to track finances and work progress. This included fetching and writing user data to an H2 <b>SQL</b> database, serving dynamically generated webpages using a <b>Java</b> servlet engine, building <b>RESTful</b> request endpoints, designing good-looking and responsive pages using <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>HTML</b>, and <b>CSS</b>, and testing/integrating new deployments on an AWS <b>EC2</b> instance.
            </p>
            <p>
                My second role was prototyping and building a ML application from the ground up on an agile team of three interns. The goal of the app was to correlate separate geospatial data streams accurately with the fewest amount of false positives in a noisy environment. I contributed by writing <b>bash</b> scripts to automate deployments and creating <b>docker-compose</b> files to configure the application as a microservice architecture. Some of these microservices included setting up interfaces for a <b>Kafka</b> message broker and web sockets to communicate between services and streaming live data, an ELK (Elasticsearch, logstash, kibana) stack to store and display data, custom pipelines to save and retrieve data from the <b>NoSQL</b> elasticsearch database, and the core correlation service. I created the core correlation service, which was a custom <b>ML</b> unsupervised clustering algorithm that would correlate disparate spatiotemporal data streams. My contributions helped the microservices cold start from completely shut down to fully operational in under a minute, and being able to correlate tens of thousands of data points in mere minutes, a task that would take data analysts days to compare one by one.
