                Hi! My name is Diego, I'm a software engineer from Denver, Colorado. I am a third year at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, pursuing a combined Bachelor's/Master's in <b>Computer Science</b> along with a Bachelor's in <b>Robotics Engineering</b>. I love to ask questions and dive head first into difficult problems! I have a passion for learning and trying new things, which is how I get the most understanding. I've been programming since high school, where I learned teamwork and software skills through my robotics team as the lead programmer. Since then, I've worked on many personal and team projects. Check them all out through the <b>projects dropdown</b> above! In my free time I like to play the guitar, climb, and build computers.

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I graduated from Denver East High School in 2022 with a certificate of academic excellence in both math and engineering. I was also very keen on learning computer science but had exhaused all the classes offered by my second year, so I took concurrent enrollment classes in computer science at both CU Denver and CU Boulder. I chose to attend WPI for a BS/MS in Computer Science and BS in Robotics Engineering for a project-based curriculum, the first and one of the best undergraduate robotics curriculums in the country, and opprotunities to travel abroad. I have made the Dean's list every semester since attending. I will be travelling to Spain in Spring of 2025 on a team developing air monitoring sensors around a school in order to help keep students in a healthy learning environment by providing administrators a digital replica of the school and showing the quality of the breathable environment. </p>

            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <p>I have worked at <a href="https://thedenovo.com/">DeNOVO Solutions</a> for the past two summers as a software engineering intern on two consecutive projects. My first role was helping an <b>agile</b> team of three software engineers develop a full-stack Atlassian Jira plugin to track finances and work progress. This included fetching and writing user data to an H2 <b>SQL</b> database, serving dynamically generated webpages using a <b>Java</b> servlet engine, building <b>RESTful</b> request endpoints, designing good-looking and responsive pages using <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>HTML</b>, and <b>CSS</b>, and testing/integrating new deployments on an AWS <b>EC2</b> instance. My second role was prototyping and building a ML application from the ground up on an agile team of three interns. The goal of the app was to correlate seperate geospatial data streams accurately with the fewest amount of false positives in a noisy environment. I contributed by writing <b>bash</b> scripts to automate deployments and creating <b>docker-compose</b> files to configure the application as a microservice architecture. Some of these microservices included setting up interfaces for a <b>Kafka</b> message broker and web sockets to communicate between services and streaming live data, an ELK (Elasticsearch, logstash, kibana) stack to store and display data, custom pipelines to save and retreive data from the <b>NoSQL</b> elasticsearch database, and the core correlation service. I created the core correlation service, which was a custom <b>ML</b> unsupervised clustering algorithm that would correlate disprate spatiotemporal data streams. My contributions helped the microservices cold start from completly shut down to fully operational in under a minute, and being able to correlate tens of thousands of data points in mere minutes, a task that would take days to compare one by one.</p>
