            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi! My name is Diego, I'm a software engineer from Denver, Colorado. I am a third year at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, pursuing a combined Bachelor's/Master's in <b>Computer Science</b> along with a Bachelor's in <b>Robotics Engineering</b>. I've been programming since high school, where I learned teamwork and software skills through my robotics team as the lead programmer. Since then, I've worked on many personal and team projects. Check them all out through the <b>projects dropdown</b> above!

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I graduated from Denver East High School in 2022 with a certificate of academic excellence in both math and engineering. I was also very keen on learning computer science but had exhaused all the classes offered by my second year, so I took concurrent enrollment classes in computer science at both CU Denver and CU Boulder. I chose to attend WPI for the project-based curriculum, the first and one of the beest undergraduate robotics curriculums in the country, and opprotunities to travel abroad. I will be travelling to Spain in Spring of 2025 on a team developing air monitoring sensors around a school in order to help keep students in a healthy learning environment by providing administrators a digital replica of the school and the safety of the breathable environment. </p>

            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <p>I have worked at <a href="https://thedenovo.com/">DeNOVO Solutions</a> for the past two summers as a software engineering intern on two consecutive projects. My first role was helping an agile team of three software engineers develop a full-stack Atlassian Jira plugin to track finances and work progress. This included fetching and writing user data to an H2 SQL database, serving dynamically generated webpages using a Java servlet engine, building RESTful request pathways between the Java back end and JavaScript front end, designing good-looking and responsive pages using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and testing/integrating new deployments on an AWS EC2 instance. My second role was prototyping and building a ML application from the ground up on an agile team of three interns. The goal of the app was to correlate seperate geospatial data streams accurately with the fewest amount of false positives in a noisy environment. I contributed to both dev ops and  included writing bash scripts to automate deployments, docker compose files, microservice architectue, Kibana message broker and web sockets for streaming live data, custom ML unsupervised learning algorithms to quickly and accurately correlate tens of thousands of data points that would take days to compare one by one </p>
